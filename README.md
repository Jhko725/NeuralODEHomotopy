## Coming soon..!
As the original code is not documented and is a bit difficult traverse, I am currently working on a refactored version of the code with Jupyter notebook examples.

The code will be uploaded before February 1st, 2024. 

In the meanwhile, if you information related to the original code or any other related information, please reach out to jhko725@snu.ac.kr - I will be happy to help!
